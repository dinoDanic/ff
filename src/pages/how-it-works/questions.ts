    question: "What are the benefits of getting a checkup when I feel healthy?",
    answer:
      "Chronic conditions don’t appear overnight.  They build up over time, often without visible symptoms.  Getting regular checkups when you’re healthy can help you establish a baseline so that you can spot early signs of chronic conditions earlier when intervention is less invasive, less expensive, and less time consuming.",

    question: "Are you a Primary Care doctor? What services do you provide?",
    answer:
      "Currently, we focus on providing preventive screening and diagnostic lab testing as well as chronic condition management for a range of conditions. We do not provide services to address acute needs like a sore throat or UTI.  We do not provide emergency medical services. If you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, please call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room.",

    question: "Are all your appointments virtual? Can I see someone in person?",
    answer:
      "All appointments with Forfend practitioners are virtual and conducted through our secure telehealth platform. As a provider of non-urgent preventive care and chronic care management, we've found that most needs can be met with the same or even better level of service virtually. For any needs that cannot be met virtually, we'll help you find a referral that meets your needs and takes your insurance.",

    question: "How much are appointments? Do you take insurance?",

    question: "Who provides the appointments? Can I select my practitioner?",
    answer:
      "We work with experienced top doctors, nurse practitioners and dietitians who are passionate about prevention and up-to-date on the latest evidence-based care. When you book, you can select your provider based on background or convenience. Feel free to switch anytime and rest assured that any provider you see will be able to pick up where the last one left off.",

    question:
      "What tests do you cover in the lab work? Do I need a blood draw?",
    answer:
      "Our lab work recommendations typically go beyond what you'd get through a standard primary care checkup. We take into account your health history, family health history, and the latest evidence-based labs. As an example, we routinely recommend comprehensive lipid panels that include particle size and count, A1c, and advanced thyroid panels to name a few. If there are additional labs that you'd like to get or don't want to get, you'll be able to indicate your preference. We optimize for your insurance, but we don't let that limit your care. If there are additional fees, you'll be able to approve them in advance. Because of the advanced nature of the lab work we do, we require a blood draw. We will create a custom lab order form that you can take to a lab near you.",
